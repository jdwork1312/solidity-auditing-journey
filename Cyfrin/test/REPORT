[S-HIGH] Storing the password on chain makes it visible to anyone, and no longer private.
 
 **Description** All data on chain is visible to anyone, and can be read directly from the blockchain.  
 The `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is intended to be a private variable and only accessed trough the `PasswordStore::getpassword` function,
 which is intended to be called only by the owner of the contract.

 We show one such method of reading any data off chain below

 ** impact ** Anyone can read the private password, severely braking the functionality of the protocol.

 The below test case shows how anyone can read the password directly from the blockchain

 **Proof Of Code:**
