ACCESS CONTROL
*   Ownable contract from OpenZeppelin: This is a well-known and widely used base contract that implements ownership and provides modifier access control out of the box.

 Best Practices:
How would you approach the audit of a smart contract that interacts with other contracts (e.g., DeFi protocols, ERC20 tokens, etc.)?

*   Review External Contract Interfaces: Understand the functions being called in external contracts, such as those for ERC20 tokens (like transfer, approve, etc.), DeFi protocols, or any external libraries.

*   Audit External Calls: When a contract interacts with other external contracts, such as transferring tokens or interacting with a DeFi protocol, there could be reentrancy risks. Always ensure that the contract updates its state before making any external calls to prevent attackers from re-entering the contract and manipulating the state.

Example: If the contract calls a token contract to transfer tokens, the state (such as user balances) should be updated before making the call.
