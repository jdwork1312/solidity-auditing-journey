*   Uninitialized Variables – If storage variables (e.g., addresses, uints) are not initialized before use, attackers can exploit them by interacting with unintended values.
*   Storage Overwriting – Attackers may write arbitrary data to uninitialized storage, overwriting critical contract data, such as the owner or balance.
*   State Manipulation – Uninitialized variables can lead to unexpected contract behavior, allowing attackers to change the state of the contract in malicious ways.

Fixes:
✅ Always initialize state variables (e.g., address, uint) in the constructor or during declaration.
✅ Avoid relying on default values (e.g., address(0) or 0) in critical logic.
✅ Use explicit checks before using uninitialized or default values.
