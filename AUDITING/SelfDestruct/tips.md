*   Contract Removal â€“ The selfdestruct() function removes the contract from the blockchain, destroying its code and state.
*   Potential for Malicious Use â€“ If an attacker can call selfdestruct(), they can permanently delete your contract, which can impact users' funds and operations.
*   Unauthenticated Access â€“ If there is no access control (e.g., onlyOwner), anyone can trigger selfdestruct(), potentially harming the contract.
*   Transfer of Funds â€“ selfdestruct() can forward the contractâ€™s balance to a specified address. If the contract is vulnerable, an attacker could steal funds before the contract is destroyed.
*   Upgradeability Risks â€“ In upgradeable contracts, misuse of selfdestruct() can prevent proper upgrades and may create problems for contract owners.


Fixes:
âœ… Restrict selfdestruct() usage to trusted addresses (e.g., onlyOwner).
âœ… Ensure no external user can trigger selfdestruct without authorization.
âœ… Check for contract termination logic carefully before using selfdestruct().
âœ… Backup contract state before destruction (if possible) for recovery.

ðŸš€ Always restrict access to selfdestruct() and only use it if absolutely necessary!
