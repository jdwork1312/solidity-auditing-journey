*   Failure to Handle Call Results â€“ Functions like call() and send() return a success/failure flag. If the result isn't checked, an attacker can exploit this by causing failures to go unnoticed.
*   Untrusted Callbacks â€“ When calling external contracts, failure to verify if a call succeeds can lead to exploits, especially in reentrancy or contract manipulation.
*   Gas Limit Risks â€“ External calls may fail if the contract exceeds the gas limit, and failing to properly handle the failure could leave the contract in an inconsistent state.


Fixes:
âœ… Always check the return values of low-level calls (call(), send(), transfer()) using require() or proper error handling.
âœ… Use safer alternatives like transfer() when sending Ether, which limits the gas to 2300 to prevent reentrancy.
âœ… Use try/catch for external contract interactions to handle exceptions properly.

ðŸš€ Unchecked external calls and uninitialized storage can lead to critical vulnerabilities. Always validate your contract interactions and initialize your storage properly!
