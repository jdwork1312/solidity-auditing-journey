*   Block Timestamps Can Be Manipulated – Miners can slightly adjust block.timestamp to their advantage.
*   Insecure Randomness – Using block.timestamp for randomness (e.g., lotteries) makes contracts predictable and exploitable.
*   Time-Based Conditions – If a contract relies on exact timing for critical logic (e.g., unlocking funds, auctions), miners can manipulate it.
*   Front-Running Risk – If an action depends on block.timestamp, attackers can anticipate and front-run transactions.
*   Short Time Windows – Contracts that check block.timestamp for time-sensitive operations can be tricked with small adjustments.


Fix:
✅ Use Chainlink VRF or other secure randomness sources.
✅ Avoid critical logic based on exact timestamps.
✅ Use block numbers instead of timestamps where possible (block.number)
