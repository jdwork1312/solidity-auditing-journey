*   Flash Loan Attack – An attacker takes a large loan and manipulates a decentralized price oracle.
*   Fake Price Feeds – If a contract relies on an untrusted oracle, attackers can provide false price data.
*   Low Liquidity Pools – If an oracle uses a thin liquidity pool, attackers can easily shift the price.

Fixes:
✅ Use Chainlink Oracles (decentralized & secure).
✅ Use TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) instead of real-time prices.
✅ Rely on multiple oracles, not just one source.
